I was unable to create the JavaDocs and Java Application Archive as I ran out of time.

-Features:

-This application will parse a text file or URL and 
display the contents asa png image in a word cloud.

-The user is first asked to choose between entering a file or a URL

-The user is then prompted to enter the file or URL

-Next a menu will display asking the user of the following options:

1-generate a word cloud
2-set image name
3-set max. words to display
4-terminate app

-if the user does not specify the image name or max. words they will
default to image.png and 25 words will display.

-When the user selects option 1 the file/URL is parsed and the image is created
where it can be found in the directory.

-When the user enters option 2 they can set the name of the image to whatever
they please.

-When the user enters option 3 they choose the amount of words that appear
on the image

-When the user enters option 4 the app will exit and the user will be brought
back to the directory.
